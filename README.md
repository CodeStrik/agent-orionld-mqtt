## Description: Intermediate agent between an Orion-LD context broker and MQTT.

This project is based on creating an agent that connects an Orion-LD broker with MQTT, with real-time translation between them, allowing a very visual and straightforward view of the status of all sensors and measuring devices. In addition, 'subscriber-mqtt.py' takes care of connecting subscribers to the different topics created automatically by the agent to be able to monitor the status of the devices.
